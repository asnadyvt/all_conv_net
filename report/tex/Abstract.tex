In this report, we review the paper The All Convolutional Net by Jost Tobias Springenberg, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox, and Martin Riedmiller.\\
Instead of building convolutional neural nets with the conventional principle, the authors experiment with models that are increasingly homogeneous. They find that both the max-pooling layer and the fullying connected layer -- which have been important parts of the CNN structures -- can be replaced by other convolutional layers. This new structure with almost purely convolutional layer is said to perform as well as the state-of-the-art CNN architectures if not better in some cases.\\
\textbf{TODO:} We find that...
