\section{Conclusion}
We read Striving for Simplicity: All Convolutional Nets \cite{springenberg2014striving} and reproduced their results for 12 different models of convolutional neural nets. Through our experiments we were able to achieve results close to those documented in the paper. Due to some important missing parameters, we were not able to exactly reproduce their results. However, we still see from our results that the error rate obtained by the All Convolution architecture is comparable to that achieved by the ConvPool architecture containing max pooling layers. Everyone contributed equally to the project.
