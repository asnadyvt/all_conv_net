# ROLLING IN THE DEEP
## Implementation of "The All Convolutional Net"

### TODO
* Weight decay, lambda = 0.001
* SGD with momentum = 0.9
* Learning rate gamma = [0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01], 0.1 for now
* Adapt learning rate at [200, 250, 300] by multiplying by 0.1
* 350 epochs
* Train all NNs with CIFAR-10
* Visualize first 3 layers
* If there is time, Visualize layers 6 and 9 and look into guided
  backprop
